# laws-lois-xml chunking / extraction

For the legislative drafting project, we want to populate a database with document chunks, metadata and their embeddings.

You must clone the [laws-lois-xml repo](https://github.com/justicecanada/laws-lois-xml) for any of these notebooks to work.

These notebooks expect to find the folders "eng", "fra" and "xslt" in the parent directory.
